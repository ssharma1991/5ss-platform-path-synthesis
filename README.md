# Synthesis of Spatial Platform with five TS dyads

A TS dyad consists of a rigid binary link with a spherical joint and a universal joint at each end. Five such links can be combined to form a one degree-of-freedom spatial mechanism which can generate complex motions. An example of 5-TS platform can be seen below. It has been modelled using Autodesk Inventor.

## Motion Synthesis (Algebraic Fitting)
In this project, we solve the spatial Burmester problem which involves finding a spatial mechanism which passes through seven poses. This problem can have upto 20 solution dyads. Selecting any five dyads can lead upto 15,504 unique solution mechanisms. Examples in publications by [Innocenti](https://doi.org/10.1115/1.2826118), [Liao and McCarthy](https://doi.org/10.1115/1.1330269), [Li et al.](https://doi.org/10.1115/DETC2014-35218) and [Ge et al.](https://doi.org/10.1115/DETC2015-47981) have been used to verify the implemented algorithm.

## Input Enhancement for Defect-free mechanism generation
In this project, a generative deep learning framework has been created which learns family of paths generated by a 5-TS platform. This framework can be used to enhance user inputs so that defect-free mechanisms can be generated.

### Data Generation
We create 7500 random spatial 5-TS mechanisms and simulate them using a solver. The solver is implemented using MATLAB and uses Newton-Rhapson optimization to create defect-free paths. This database represents a family of paths a general 5-TS mechanism can achieve.

### Data Preprocessing
Before the generated data can be used for machine learning, the data needs to be normalized, cleaned and augmented. 
- A 7500 simulated coupler curves are represented using $n$ 3-D datapoints each where $n$ ranges from 2 to 3126. Curves made of less than 10 datapoints are ignored since they contain extremely less information. 
- First, we normalize the total number of points used to represent the remaining 7408 coupler curves. A fourth order b-spline interpolation curve is fitted to the these curves. Then, 100 datapoints are uniformly sampled on each curve leading to an arc-length parametrization.
- Next, the location, orentation and scale of these curves are normalized. The mean of curves is translated to origin. The principal axes of curve are rotated to align with x,y,z axes. The curves are scaled to unit arc-length.
- When the solver is simulating a 5ss-mechanism, it may jump from one branch to another due to inherent limitations of numerical methods. These invalid coupler paths have extremely high curvature/torsion at points where the branch jump happens. The z-score of Max Curvature, Max Torsion and Min Torsion values is used to filter these outliers. This results in a clean database containing 7200 coupler paths.
- The database in its present form is unbalanced i.e. it has more samples of coupler paths which are more probable while lesser samples of other more diverse examples. This leads to the algorithm not learning well since it comes across the more probable examples most of the time. To overcome this bias, a limited number of diverse paths are selected from the complete database by undersampling similar curves. A metric based on Curvature and Torsion properties is used to compare the similatity of two curves. This leads to a balanced DB containing 5021 coupler paths.
- According to the domain knowledge, we know that if a path is a valid coupler path, its mirrored curve is also a valid path. Thus, coupler paths mirrored across xy,yz and zx planes are added to encorage the model to be invariant to mirror operations.
- It is desirable for our algorithm to be able to handle missing input data. To enable this, we augment the data with paths missing random information and also create the mask representing the missing information.
- Finally, some noise is added to all the curves. This acts as a regularizer to ML algorithm, encourages robust learning and avoids overfitting.


### Deep Learning
Many different architectures are being tested to find the best for our use-case.

# Synthesis of Spatial Platform with five TS dyads

A TS dyad consists of a rigid binary link with a spherical joint and a universal joint at each end. Five such links can be combined to form a one degree-of-freedom spatial mechanism which can generate complex motions. 

In this project, we solve the spatial Burmester problem which involves finding a spatial mechanism which passes through seven poses. This problem can have upto 20 solution dyads. Selecting any five dyads can lead upto 15,504 unique solution mechanisms. Examples in publications by [Innocenti](https://doi.org/10.1115/1.2826118), [Liao and McCarthy](https://doi.org/10.1115/1.1330269), [Li et al.](https://doi.org/10.1115/DETC2014-35218) and [Ge et al.](https://doi.org/10.1115/DETC2015-47981) have been used to verify the implemented algorithm.

An example of 5-TS platform can be seen below. It has been modelled using Autodesk Inventor.
